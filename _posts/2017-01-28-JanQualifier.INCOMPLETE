<p>This Saturday was a crazy experience. The day started with our arrival at the site with our sister team Iron Reign. We unloaded
the bot into the pit and got everything set up. Next, we went in to our presentation room with the judges. Although our presentation
was strong, we were not able to demonstrate our bot and its functionalities. We decided to create a stronger presentation for 
next time.</p>

<p>Next thing on the day's schedule was the qualification matches. Our first match was match number 1. During this match,
we ran into several issues. Although our autonomous worked successfully, our teleop was not working properly. Our phones would
spontaneously stop communicating and our driver was not able to drive the bot. However, we ended up winning that match 30 points
to 0 points. We went back to attempt to fix this issue. Our second math was match number 8. Coincidentally, this match was
played so that we were against our sister team! We were deciding who would let the other one win but strangely, the match ended
up tieing!</p>

<p>Again, our robot was malfunctioning during this match. We kept getting errors that the motor controllers were inactive and
were dead. Another team at the event suggested that we rewire everything and restart the robot. This seemed to do the trick.
Our third match was match 13. In this match, our robot was successful in autonomous alongside our alliance partner's code. All
was going well until our robot suddenly died and would not turn back on again. Although we won the match, this was an issue that
seriously needed to be addressed. We did our best to fix the issue before the following match by trying the rewiring method again.
Our 4th qualification match was match 19. Something incredibly strange occured during this match. We decided not to run our
autonomous since our alliance partner had a similar autonomous but theirs was more reliable. However, during the driver control
period, our robot would flicker on and off with errors! This was incredibly strange as we had no idea what was going wrong. 
We tried to do everything we could to fix the bot for our final qualification match. We tried resetting the phones, fixing
any connection issue, rewiring the motor controllers, replacing the battery, etc. We ended up getting it to almost work.
During the match, our robot threw the errors again and died. Strangely, this match was between rank 1 and 2 vs rank 3 and 4
(we were surprisngly rank 4). We won the match but we were bumped down to rank 6 by the end of the qualification matches</p>
