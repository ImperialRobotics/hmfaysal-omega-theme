<h1>Imperial Robotics Team 3734</h1>

<img src="{{ site.url }}/images/GroupPicture.JPG" alt="Team">

<p>We are FTC team 3734, A.K.A. Imperial Robotics located at the School of Science and Engineering in Dallas, TX. Our mission is to spread robotics in the world so that people learn how fun and engaging the robotics competitions of FIRST are. This year,
we hope to participate in several community service projects and build a robot using the help of the community. We
want to bring everyone together to create something that is truly revolutionary.</p>

<p>
  Hello! My name is Maximo Mateo.I'm currently a Junior at the School Of Science and Engineering at Townview Magnet Center.This is my
  first year in robotics. I joined robotics so I could apply my knowledge in Physics and Computer Science to robotics. I also joined robotics
  so I could experience teamwork, programming, and building. Learning these things in robotics can be useful in the future because we're dealing
  with real-life situations.Such as Robots!!!

   Hello, I'm Christian Saldana and I am sophomore at the School of Science and Engineering. I am given certain task on the robot
  by the captain and get the help of others if needed. Sometimes its to build a part or attatch parts. I came to robotics in hope 
  of gaining experience towards becoming an engineer in the future.
