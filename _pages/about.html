<p>
  Hi! My name is Abhi Bhattaru. I go to the Science and Engineering Magnet at Townview and I am currently in 10th grade. Being the lead
  developer, I work closely with managing this blog and its innerworkings. I do my best to document all meetings as well as any special
  events that our team participates in. I joined robotics due my fascination with math and science and its incredible applications
  in current situations in the world.
